# Metacrafters Building on Avalanche - ETH + AVAX

This is a simple project for Metacrafters to understand the basics of Avalance network in deploying ERC20 tokens

## Description

The contract was deployed on a Avalance Fuji Test network and was developed using hardhat in visual studio code and Remix to access and do functionalities with the smart contract

## Getting Started

The contract can be accessed in this address: "0x28903EA2c14E087a4f12b22266B0C99C9431A904" if would like to check the functions I used for the demo and verify their transactions.

### Executing program

To run this code will require an IDE, Node js and a library called hardhat.

Once the repository has been cloned you need to peform these commands in your terminal:

Run the commands below to be able to launch the token on a local hardhat network.
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

Once the contract is deployed, the terminal/console should notify you where the contract is deployed and you can use the address to access it.

You can use Remix IDE to connect to the token.
