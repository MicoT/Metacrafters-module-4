### Executing program

To run this code will require an IDE, Node js and a library called hardhat.

Once the repository has been cloned you need to peform these commands in your terminal:

Run the commands below to be able to launch the token on a local hardhat network.
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat

npx hardhat node

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Once the contract is deployed, the terminal/console should notify you where the contract is deployed and you can use the address to access it.
